#I am also removing records that have zero or negative values. I investigated these and they are from the seabird CTDs and result in a poor dark count as they pull the mean down. 

#there are still values that go very low that are not being removed. Need to look at these. I think removing flu values that are < 0.01 will target most of these - they are all from 7674 and deep. This helped, but still some downspikes -  if I raise the threshhold then it starts to include some surface values from 80217 that were very low - probably either had air/bubbles or strong NPQ.

I was using 100m, but there was one profile that had a minima between 50-100m. This minima was slightly lower than the deeper waters, so doesn't make a huge difference, but good to target the lowest values.
